# ZSH Config

## Handling plugins

I like to commit to source control exactly what is needed for the plugins I use.

### zsh-autosuggestions

Only `.zsh` files are needed

### zsh-completions

`src/*` binaries are needed by the root `.zsh` file.

### zsh-syntax-highlighting

`.version` and `.revision-hash` are used alongside all `.zsh` files.
